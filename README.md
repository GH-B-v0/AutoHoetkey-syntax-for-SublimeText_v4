# AutoHoetkey-syntax-for-SublimeText_v4
How about having a richer syntax highlighting for AutoHotkey in sublime text v4?  
this might be to your likings. its customized to with specific color preferences.  
try it.  


## Requirements
  Sublime Text v4.  
  AutoHotkey.  


## Installation
  Place the 'AutoHotkey' folder at './Data/Packages'.
  place the 'Default (Windows).sublime-keymap' file at './Data/Packages/User'.


## Usage
  Checkout the 'Default (Windows).sublime-keymap' file for keyboard shortcuts.  
  change them to your preferences.  
  when viewing an 'ahk' file, press one of those hotkeys. the file will be executed automatically by AutoHotkey.  
  

  
## Note
  This repository is enhanced syntax highlighting for AutoHotkey for Sublime Text v4 (it muight work with st3 too! not tested) with the same base files from a git repo with (almost) same name.  


  
## Credits
  Thanks to those writing the main syntax file.  
  not sure which repo was it (sorry it was a long time ago) but i guess it was this one:  
  https://github.com/egocarib/AutoHotkey2  
  which it was a fork of  
  https://github.com/aviaryan/AutoHotkey
